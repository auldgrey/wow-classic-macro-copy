# wow-classic-macro-copy
A simple Windows batch script to copy macro files to a Documents folder for backup or upload to your favorite cloud storage to share between PCs.

The files should be copied into your user Documents folder:
  %USERPROFILE%\Documents\wow_macros

The copy TO script has not been done yet.  I suppose I'd rather just manually copy things into the directory to make sure I don't perform an unwanted write.
